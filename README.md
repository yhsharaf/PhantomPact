# Phantom Pact: online co-op for Phantom Blade Zero

English | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

Phantom Pact adds online co-op to **Phantom Blade Zero**. Two players each run their own game and keep their own
save, and Phantom Pact links the two worlds: you see each other, fight the same enemies, take on bosses as a team,
share loot and dust, and rest at bells together. The host's world leads, and your partner joins in.

## Features

- See your partner's Soul live, with their moves, attacks, dodges and hit reactions
- Shared enemies in both worlds, with shared health, posture and executions
- Your partner's hits count in the host's world, so you can fight the same enemy together
- Shared boss fights: the boss health bar and arena fog walls for both players
- Shared loot and dust: what either player picks up or earns goes to both
- Shared resting: rest at a bell and enemies respawn for both
- Elden Ring–style co-op difficulty: enemies and bosses get more health and posture while you play together
- PvP duels (`PvP = On`): the game's own block, parry and dodge; parries stagger the attacker; the loser dies
- A partner compass in the game's ink style, your partner on the map in jade, partner tips, and spectating your
  partner while you're down
- Optional `Secret` that signs every packet; works over Tailscale, Hamachi, Radmin, ZeroTier, UU Accelerator, and
  Steam (beta)

## Quick start

1. Install [UE4SS for Phantom Blade Zero](https://www.nexusmods.com/phantombladezero/mods/5) and [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) (both players).
2. Extract the release zip into the game's `PBZ` folder.
3. In `platform\steam\ue4ss\Mods\PBZCoop\PhantomPact.ini`: host sets `Role = Host`, guest sets `HostAddress` to
   the host's Tailscale IP.
4. Start the game and load your saves, the host first. Co-op starts by itself.

Early release, 2 players. Tailscale or any virtual LAN; Steam joining is in beta (see INSTALL.md).

## Ground rules

- **No DRM bypassing.** Phantom Pact never touches Denuvo or patches the game executable. Everything loads
  through UE4SS and runs inside the normal, legitimately owned game.
- Each player needs their own copy of the game.
- Nothing here contains game files or assets.

## For developers

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| [mod/PBZCoop/](mod/PBZCoop/) | UE4SS Lua mod: `coop.lua` (online sync), `pbz.lua` (game adapter: enemies, health, moves, bosses, items), `autostart.lua` (reads `PhantomPact.ini`, starts the relay, turns sync on), `main.lua` (loader, commands) |
| [native/](native/) | The relay players run: C++, loaded by UE4SS as `dlls\main.dll` inside the game. Build with `tools\build-native.ps1` (Visual Studio 2022) |
| [net/pbzcoop_net.py](net/pbzcoop_net.py) | The same relay in Python, with the same packets and files: the fallback if the DLL isn't running, plus echo and record/replay for testing |
| [net/test_pbzcoop_net.py](net/test_pbzcoop_net.py) | Relay tests: `python -I net\test_pbzcoop_net.py`; set `PBZCOOP_NATIVE_RELAY` to `native\build\relay_cli.exe` to test the C++ relay, against itself or the Python one |
| [net/pbzcoop_bot.py](net/pbzcoop_bot.py) | Bot partner for live tests without a second PC |
| [tools/pbz-coop.ps1](tools/pbz-coop.ps1) | Developer launcher: relay + `neton` by hand (`-Role host/client/echo/loop/record/replay`, `-Stop`) |
| [tools/install-mod.ps1](tools/install-mod.ps1) | Installs the mod into the game's UE4SS `Mods` folder (finds the game through Steam) |
| [tools/pbz-e2e.ps1](tools/pbz-e2e.ps1) | End-to-end test: two copies of the game on one PC, PASS/FAIL per feature; `-Auto` tests the player setup (ini, self-started relays) |
| [tools/pbz-selftest.ps1](tools/pbz-selftest.ps1) | Starts two copies with `-allowmultipleinstances` plus relays; `-Stop` |
| [tools/make-release.ps1](tools/make-release.ps1) | Builds `dist\PhantomPact-<version>.zip` |
| [docs/COOP_GUIDE.md](docs/COOP_GUIDE.md) | What syncs and how: protocol, enemy matching, tests and results |
