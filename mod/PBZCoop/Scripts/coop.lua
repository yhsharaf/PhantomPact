--       M <move>             the sender's player started an attack/dodge/special move
--       D <enemy> <hp> <posture> [L]   client -> host: the client's player took this much health/posture off
--                            it; L = a killing blow (the client's copy is held at 1 health, so the host kills it)
--       B <boss>             the sender's game started a boss fight with this enemy
--       R [bell|death]       the sender rested at a bell, or the host died and respawned: enemies respawn on both
--                            PCs (a client's own death respawn isn't sent: only its world refreshes)
--       C <amount>           the sender gained this much dust (currency): shared rewards
--       H <hit state tag>    the sender's player started a hit reaction; their ghost plays the same one
--       K <enemy>            host -> client: this enemy died
--       I <pickup>           this pickup/chest was taken
--
-- Roles: the host's world is the truth for enemies (positions, health, deaths); the client mirrors it and
-- reports its own hits. Each side shows the other's player as a "ghost" Hun steered by movement input.
-- Who decides what (and why) is written up in docs/AUTHORITY.md.
-- "echo" (solo testing) runs as host and also treats its own echoed events as the friend's.
